MiniChallenge #5: FiveToSeven - Endpoints

Description: Created four endpoints for Madlib, OddOrEven, ReverseIt (Alphanumeric) and ReverseIt with numbers ONLY. Input Validation is implemented!

//Peer Review:Xavier-Everything works as need and it run well the mad lab was good and 
I like you choose to go more with the it by having 13 inputs, all the api work no issues looks good to me.
